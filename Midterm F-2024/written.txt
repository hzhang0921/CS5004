1. I noticed that according to the UML, Produce Item's arrow implies that it contains/has basicItems. This is wrong, since in our case, produceItems are basicItems. In our case, produceItems is extending basicItems.
2. I'm unsure if this is wrong, but the IntelliJ UML includes the existence of a main class. This is unneccessary since we are not running anything in these classes, just using them to connect to other classes.
3. In the IntelliJ UML, the arrows are all filled. I believe that when you are indicating implementation, it should be a dotted and not-filled line.
